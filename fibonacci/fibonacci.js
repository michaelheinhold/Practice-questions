// The fibonacci sequence is defined by the relation Xn = Xn-1 + Xn-2.

// The first few numbers of the series are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.

// given the above write a function that when given an index returns the value of that index using the fibonacci sequence

// for example if I give you 7, the function should return 13, given 3 returns 2 etc.
